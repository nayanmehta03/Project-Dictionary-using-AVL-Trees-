# Project-Dictionary-using-AVL-Trees-
GUI Project of making a Dictionary using JavaFX. AVL Trees have been used to store words and search for faster search time. As there was a handicap of not using JDBC at runtime i had to serialize the AVL Tree into byte stream and stored into dictionary.txt.
Auto Complete feature has been implemented using ControlsFX library. These suggestions have also been serialized for same reasons. App downloads files if they doesn't exits in same directory as the src.
